\chapter{What the MCR does for you}

\section{Freshers' Fortnight}
One of the most important things that the MCR does is to provide two weeks of
entertainment and orientation for you when you arrive. Details will be published
when you arrive (both in your pidge and posted around accommodation). The first event will be a welcome brunch held in the  Spoom\ref{ssec:Spoom} at 11am on Sunday of 0th week (2nd
October).
This will be followed by a wide range of events: parties, dinners, pub crawls, cultural events, teas and many more events to help you settle in. It all finishes with the matriculation ceremony on Saturday of 1st week when you formally become part of the University. You do not need to matriculate if you have already studied at Oxford, Cambridge, or Trinity College, Dublin. Remember to wear your sub-fusc and gown to matriculation!

\section{Guest night}
Our main regular social events are \emph{guest nights}. MCR guest nights happen
every second Friday of odd weeks, bringing the total to four a term. Dinner is usually of a very
high standard and costs \pounds15.55 (on your battles). Members may invite up to four guests to
join them, although many prefer to enjoy the evening with friends from college. Dress is smart, but gowns are not required. After dinner, there are second desserts provided by the MCR which include a selection of cheeses, fruit, chocolate and port, as well as the bar being open. Everyone is welcome to come to this even if you didn't attend the dinner.

Guest nights are very popular and you need to sign-up early on
\url{food.new.ox.ac.uk} to avoid disappointment. Sign-ups start a week early: at
12:01\,am on the preceding Friday.

\section{End-of-year garden party} 
At the end of Trinity term the MCR holds an end-of-year party to say goodbye to the many people
leaving Oxford. Enjoy a bouncy castle, music, (hopefully!) sun, games, Pimmâ€™s, amazing food and other summer delights taking you from the day to dancing at night!

\section{Exchange dinners}
We have \emph{exchanges} with other colleges, whereby we host them at New
College for drinks and dinner and then they do the same for us. Drinks and second desserts are included. These events vary between being a special dinner with high table food or occurring during regular formal dinners. The MCR also tries to do an exchange with a Cambridge college once a year. This year, we will be getting in touch with King's College, Cambridge, so keep an eye on the MCR Facebook page and the mailing list!

\section{Brunch}
During term, and occasionally out of term, the MCR hosts a free brunch in the
Spoom on Sunday mornings at 11\,am. This is a good way to catch up with friends and meet new people. Arrive early to avoid missing out on the smoked salmon!

\section{Bar Nights}
During term the MCR opens the bar between 9.00-11.00\,pm on a Wednesday and
Thursday. The bar is also open on alternate Friday evenings and the occasional Saturday evening.

\section{Bar Nights}
During term the MCR opens the bar between 9.00-11.00 pm on a Wednesday and Thursday. The bar is also open on alternate Friday evenings and the occasional Saturday evening. Whether you are getting ready for a big night out or are looking for a quiet evening, feel free to come around!

\section{Bops}
Bops are the highlight of the MCR party scene. Around once a term the MCR will throw parties with a fun theme in the Spoom. They normally occur after guest night dinners and the bar remains open later than usual. The MCR members take turn DJing at the bops, so make sure to email Jack Stefaniak (\href{mailto:jakub.stefaniak@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{jakub.stefaniak@new.ox.ac.uk}}) if you are interested! Other colleges also host their own Bops located on their grounds, which you are welcome to attend if advertised. The MCR sometimes co-hosts a bop with another college - last year we successfully hosted a bop together with St. Catherine's college!

\section{New Collection}
The MCR's own multi-disciplinary academic journal, The New Collection, aims to present the breadth and depth of work currently being undertaken by the graduate members of New College. All work contained within the journal is by current graduate MCR members and every MCR member is encouraged to get involved by either submitting an article or during the editorial phase.

The New Collection provides members the unique opportunity of learning both how to write and review journal articles all within the supportive structure of New College, making us the envy of other colleges. Successful articles this year came from a variety of disciplines and were aimed at a broad readership, which is the original aim of the New Collection - to bring the current work of our MCR members to a larger intellectual audience.

\section{Roundtables discussions}
Roundtable discussions create a opportunity for members of the MCR to get together and discuss a mutual topic of interest. Topics are suggested by members of the MCR on anything they find interesting, from current affairs to literature to science. Topics are then advertised in advance and any member of the MCR can choose to participate in the discussion or simply watch and join in in an open discussion at the end. Each discussant prepares 3-5minutes of material on which they want to talk, and after each discussant has talked the conversation is open to anyone. Previous topics include artificial intelligence and power in ancient Greece.

The MCR Vice-President organizes the roundtable discussions and is always seeking MCR members
keen to suggest a topic or participate in a discussion, so please consider doing so, emailing Emma Riley
(\href{mailto:emma.riley@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{emma.riley@new.ox.ac.uk}})
if you are interested.


\section{The MCR play}
The Arts and Culture organizes every year a theatre played performed in Trinity
term either in the college garden or cloisters. Actors and Production team are
selected primarily from volunteers from the MCR. The play is usually on stage for an entire weekend and requires around six weeks of preparation and rehearsals. In 2015 the MCR produced Hay Fever, a comedy set in the '20s, obtaining a great success across both college and non-college audiences. If you want to be involved with the next MCR theatre play, get in touch with Dionysios (\href{mailto:dionysios.kyropoulos@music.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{dionysios.kyropoulos@music.ox.ac.uk}}).

\section{Other events}
The MCR puts on several other events during the term in addition to the regulars. These include orchestral concert trips, MCR quizzes, a play, cheese and wine tasting, cocktail making masterclasses, BBQs and an Easter egg hunt. These occur regularly throughout term, so keep an eye on the MCR mailing list and Facebook page for adverts.
