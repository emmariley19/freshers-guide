\section{The MCR committee}

The MCR is run by a committee of students. Getting involved in the committee is great fun and a good way of being part of college life. You will hear more about how you can do this during freshers' fortnight. You can find the current MCR committee position holders and their blurbs on:
\url{http://mcr.new.ox.ac.uk/?n=Main.PeopleCommittee}

\noindent Please contact the committee with any queries. 

\noindent Our e-mail addresses can be found on the committee webpage above, or
by simply following the usual pattern of
\emph{\urlformat{firstname.lastname@new.ox.ac.uk}} (which is valid for most
members of the college).
If you are unsure of an e-mail address you can also search on

\section{People in college}

\begin{description}

\item[The Warden]
The Warden is the head of college, and is ultimately responsible for all aspects of college life. 

From August 2016, this role will be taken by Mr Miles Young, who is the Chairman and CEO of one of the world's largest communications groups, Oglivy \& Mather.

The Warden lives in \emph{the Warden's lodgings}, accessed via the Front Quad.
He also has a private garden (\emph{the Warden's garden} - starting to get the
conventions?) which has amazing views of New College, Hertford College, and All Souls College.
Appointments to see the Warden can be made through the college secretary (\href{mailto:warden@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{warden@new.ox.ac.uk}}).

\item[Tutor for Graduates]
The Tutor for Graduates is a college fellow who, in addition to his or her academic duties, oversees the general well-being of the MCR within the New College community. The Tutor for Graduates also reviews each graduate student's termly reports, and negotiates with faculty supervisors and college advisers as appropriate. Additionally, he or she signs graduate applications for transfer or confirmation of status, and liaises with the Proctors, the University's regulatory officers, on the behalf of college members.

Graduate students may also draw on certain academic allowances, and the Tutor for Graduates reviews all these applications, as well as advises on scholarship possibilities. The Tutor for Graduates meets MCR committee members regularly over lunch to discuss academic and social life in the MCR, and also invites regular groups of graduates to High Table dinners, and hosts a couple of full MCR dinners in Hall each year. Finally, the Tutor for Graduates represents the MCR to the Governing Body, the sovereign body of college, which meets around three times a term. 

Any graduate who wishes to discuss their academic or social progress is referred to their college adviser in the first instance, but if you encounter any problems requiring more urgent attention, the Tutor for Graduates is always available. All enquiries concerning graduate matters should be directed to the College Office, which administrates for the Tutor for Graduates.

The Tutor for Graduates is currently Prof George Ratcliffe. A letter from him
welcoming you to New College was sent to you during the long vacation. You can
contact Professor Ratcliffe through 
\href{mailto:george.ratcliffe@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{george.ratcliffe@new.ox.ac.uk}}.

\item[Your College Advisor]
The Tutor for Graduates assigns each graduate student an academic advisor in college, typically a college fellow who works in the subject area of their advisee, but who is not their advisee's main supervisor. Your advisor is supposed to be your first port of call if you have any academic difficulties on which you would like an independent opinion.

Your advisor should contact you during your first term via your Oxford email address. The purpose of this contact is purely to touch base and ensure your transition to Oxford is proceeding smoothly. You are also encouraged to make contact with them. If you have any problems with your adviser please contact either the MCR President or the Tutor for Graduates.

\item[Bursar]
The Bursar, David Palfreyman, is responsible for the college's finances. If you have any unforeseeable financial difficulties he may be able to help you. Appointments to see him should be made through his secretary, either by going to the Bursar's Office (4OB1) or by emailing \href{mailto:bursar@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{bursar@new.ox.ac.uk}}.

\item[Home Bursar]
The Home Bursar, Caroline Thomas, is responsible for the domestic side of college life, including accommodation, college staff, and food. She is also part of the welfare team. Contact her either by e-mail (\href{mailto:caroline.thomes@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{caroline.thomes@new.ox.ac.uk}}) or in the Home Bursary on the ground floor of 4OB.

\item[Dean]
The Dean, Dr Michael Burden, is responsible for discipline in college. Day-to-day running of this side is carried out by the Assistant Dean and three Junior Deans. If you want to hold an event in college, you have to apply to the Assistant Dean for permission. Hopefully, this is the only time you will have to see the decanal team!

\item[IT Officer]
James Dore is the college's IT Officer. His team is responsible for the computer provision in college. They are available to deal with any computer related issues you may have. They have an office in the Garden Quad (12OB-2) and can also be reached through
\href{mailto:it-support@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{it-support@new.ox.ac.uk}}

\item[Welfare Fellows (Cox/Salvesen Fellows)]
College employs two Junior Research Fellows who also have a welfare role; they
are called the \emph{Cox and Salvesen Fellows}. They are currently Tom Cutterham (\href{mailto:tom.cutterham@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{tom.cutterham@new.ox.ac.uk}}) and Ryan Hanley (\href{mailto:ryan.hanley@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{ryan.hanley@new.ox.ac.uk}}), respectively.


\item[Porters]
The Porters live in the lodge in the Holywell Quad (there is also a lodge at the sports ground) and are the first port of call for all everyday issues in college, e.g. lost keys, light bulbs, etc. The Porters work long hours and deal with all the various and quirky needs of college members. Please be polite and friendly when dealing with staff at either lodge.
