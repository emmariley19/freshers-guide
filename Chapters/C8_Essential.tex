\chapter{Essential admin after arrival}

\section{Room key}
The first thing to do when you arrive is to go to the main porters' lodge, next
to the Holywell Street entrance to New College, where the porters will tell you where you will be living and will issue you with a room key.
\section{Bod-card}
Your Bodleian reader card, always referred to as your \emph{Bod-card}, is effectively
your university card. You need it to get into college and college buildings, buy food in hall, drinks in the bar and to get into most buildings and departments across the university. It is therefore something you need to get hold of as soon as possible. You can collect your Bod card from the graduate office in 4OB3.
\section{E-mail lists}
E-mail is the standard form of communication within the university, and you should check your account regularly. You must activate your college email address as soon as possible after arrival. There are two e-mail lists in college which you need to know about:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Main list: The main list is run by college and important
information is sent out using it. E-mails come through with the subject line
\emph{[new-mcr]}. College should sign you up to it but inevitably they miss a
few people. If you don't seem to receive any e-mails with this subject, report
it to report it to the MCR's IT Officer, Daniel Matore (\href{mailto:daniel.matore@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{rina.hay@new.ox.ac.uk}})) or to the College IT support (\href{mailto:it-support@new.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{it-support@new.ox.ac.uk}}), because you need to be on this list.
  \item Social list: This list is administered by the MCR IT rep and has subject line
\emph{[newmcr-l]}. It is used by the president, social secretaries, welfare rep and sports rep for
sending out notices and information about what is happening in the MCR. We will
try and add you automatically, but a lot of people don't get signed up, so you
should do this yourself. E-mail
\href{mailto:newmcr-l-subscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk }{\urlformat{newmcr-l-subscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk}}
from any e-mail account to be added to the list. In order to unsubscribe you can
e-mail
\href{mailto:newmcr-l-unsubscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk}{\urlformat{newmcr-l-unsubscribe@maillist.ox.ac.uk}}.
\end{enumerate}
