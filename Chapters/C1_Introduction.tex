Dear New College MCR Freshers,

\medskip

\noindent On behalf of the Middle Common Room, I am delighted to welcome you to New College. 

\medskip

\noindent The MCR is a lively and diverse graduate community, and a great place
to meet and socialise with interesting people from around the world. Our MCR members share a strong bond, and the MCR is likely to be a place where you will make some of your best friends at Oxford. I encourage you to become actively involved in the MCR and to take advantage of the many facilities and social events throughout your time at Oxford.

\medskip

\noindent Our Committee has put this guide together as a resource to help you
settle into life at New College. In it you can find useful information about New College, Oxford University, and the greater city of Oxford. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me or any other committee member if you have any questions.

\medskip

\noindent I also encourage you to visit our
\href{http://mcr.new.ox.ac.uk/?n=Main.HomePage}{\urlformat{website}}, which has
additional resources and up-to-date information about all our activities on our live calendar.

\medskip

\noindent The MCR and I look forward to meeting you at Freshers' Fortnight in
October.

\medskip

\noindent Best wishes for an enjoyable rest of the summer!

\bigskip

\noindent Arnold J. Th. M. Mathijssen
