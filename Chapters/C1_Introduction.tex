Dear New College MCR Freshers of 2016,

\medskip

\noindent On behalf of the Middle Common Room (MCR), I am delighted to welcome you to New College. 

\medskip

\noindent New College is home to one of the oldest and most active MCR communities of any of the colleges at Oxford, and is comprised of approximately 330 graduate students spanning more than 25 countries across the world. 

\medskip
\noindent The MCR is designed to be a graduateâ€™s home during their time at Oxford and is supported by the MCR committee, which organise several events each term, such as formal dinners, exchanges with other colleges, academic colloquia, and much more.
\medskip

\noindent Our committee has put together this guide as a useful resource to help you settle into life at New College. 

\medskip

\noindent There is also plenty of useful information on the MCR website \href{http://mcr.new.ox.ac.uk/?n=Main.HomePage}{\urlformat{website}}, which has
additional resources and up-to-date information about all our activities on our live calendar.

\medskip

\noindent I look forward to meeting you at Freshers' Fortnight in October.
